## What is this?
I tried to make a keyboard that is easy to use and compact. For this it has an (oversized) 9-key thumbfan and a (non-oversized) 4x6 matrix.

(Only the left side of the keyboard is shown)

## Features
- 9-key thumbfan
- 4x6 matrix
- 2 trrs jacks on each side (four in total) for flexibility: on each side you can choose which one to use
- 2 elite-c controllers -> usb-c

## Downsides of this layout
As soon as I had soldered the keyboard, I noticed that the 4 outer thumb keys (On the right on the picture) were hard to reach and I am still not using them after a month of using this keyboard.
The 2 that are just next to the thumb home (the next 2 on the left of the previous) are easier to use but I prefer to use the 2 inner.
In short, that means I could have saved 6 keys on each side's thumfan.

## What I would do differently
I would let the matrix as is, remove the 4 outer thumfan keys and add a few degrees to the angle added to the next 2.
